[.lead]
An {url-asdf}[asdf] plugin to manage https://ada-lang.io[Ada/GNAT] compiler versions seamlessly across projects.

toc::[]

== Overview

=== What is Ada?

https://ada-lang.io[Ada] is a structured, statically typed, imperative, and object-oriented high-level programming language designed for safety-critical and mission-critical systems. Originally developed in the 1980s for the U.S. Department of Defense, Ada is renowned for:

* **Strong typing** — Catches errors at compile time rather than runtime
* **Built-in concurrency** — Native tasking support for parallel programming
* **Contract-based programming** — Pre/post conditions and type invariants
* **Real-time systems support** — Deterministic behavior for embedded systems
* **Long-term maintainability** — Designed for systems with 30+ year lifecycles

Ada is used in aerospace (Boeing, Airbus), defense systems, rail transportation, medical devices, and financial systems where reliability is paramount.

=== What is asdf?

{url-asdf}[asdf] is a universal version manager that allows you to manage multiple runtime versions with a single CLI tool. Instead of juggling separate version managers for each language, asdf provides one interface to rule them all.

=== Why asdf-ada?

Managing Ada/GNAT compiler versions traditionally requires manual downloads, environment variable configuration, and careful PATH management. `asdf-ada` simplifies this by providing:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Feature |Benefit

|**Version Switching**
|Switch between GNAT versions instantly per project

|**Project Isolation**
|Each project can specify its required Ada version via `.tool-versions`

|**Reproducible Builds**
|Team members and CI/CD pipelines use identical compiler versions

|**Multiple Distributions**
|Support for FSF GNAT, GNAT Community, and Alire-managed toolchains

|**Cross-Platform**
|Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL)
|===

== Prerequisites

=== System Requirements

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Platform |Minimum Version |Notes

|**Linux**
|Ubuntu 20.04+ / Fedora 35+ / Debian 11+
|x86_64 and aarch64 supported

|**macOS**
|macOS 11 (Big Sur)+
|Intel and Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)

|**Windows**
|Windows 10+ with WSL2
|Native support planned for future releases
|===

=== Dependencies

Before installing the plugin, ensure you have the following:

[source,bash]
----
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y curl git build-essential libc6-dev

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install -y curl git gcc glibc-devel

# macOS (via Homebrew)
brew install curl git
xcode-select --install  # For build tools

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S curl git base-devel
----

=== asdf Installation

If you haven't installed asdf yet:

[source,bash]
----
# Clone asdf
git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf --branch v0.14.0

# Add to your shell (bash)
echo '. "$HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo '. "$HOME/.asdf/completions/asdf.bash"' >> ~/.bashrc

# Add to your shell (zsh)
echo '. "$HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh"' >> ~/.zshrc

# Add to your shell (fish)
echo 'source ~/.asdf/asdf.fish' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish

# Reload your shell
exec $SHELL
----

== Installation

=== Adding the Plugin

[source,bash]
----
# Add the asdf-ada plugin
asdf plugin add ada https://github.com/hyperpolymath/asdf-ada-plugin.git

# Verify installation
asdf plugin list
----

=== Installing Ada/GNAT Versions

[source,bash]
----
# List all available versions
asdf list all ada

# Install a specific version
asdf install ada 14.1.0        # FSF GNAT 14.1.0
asdf install ada community-2021 # GNAT Community 2021
asdf install ada alire-latest   # Latest via Alire

# Install the latest stable version
asdf install ada latest
----

=== Setting the Version

[source,bash]
----
# Set global default (used when no local version is specified)
asdf global ada 14.1.0

# Set local version for current project (creates .tool-versions)
asdf local ada 14.1.0

# Set version for current shell session only
asdf shell ada 14.1.0

# Verify the active version
asdf current ada
gnatmake --version
----

== Usage

=== Project Configuration

Create a `.tool-versions` file in your project root:

[source]
----
ada 14.1.0
----

When you `cd` into the project directory, asdf automatically activates the specified version.

=== Available Commands

[source,bash]
----
# List installed versions
asdf list ada

# Show current version
asdf current ada

# Uninstall a version
asdf uninstall ada 13.2.0

# Reshim after installing Ada tools (e.g., via Alire)
asdf reshim ada

# Show installation path
asdf where ada 14.1.0
----

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

[qanda]
Version not found when running `gnatmake`::
Run `asdf reshim ada` after installation and ensure your shell is properly configured.

Download fails with SSL errors::
Ensure `ca-certificates` is installed: `sudo apt-get install ca-certificates`

"Permission denied" during installation::
Check write permissions for `~/.asdf/installs/ada/`

Slow downloads::
Set `ASDF_ADA_MIRROR` to a geographically closer mirror.
